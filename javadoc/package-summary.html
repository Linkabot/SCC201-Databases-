 IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION:
        
THE DESIGNS FOR THE INTERGALACTIC SUPER HERO DATABASE HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY RECOVERED!
        
Agent Indigo retrieved access to a (*\schrod{}*) file containing a Zylon Information Package (zip file) 
from a portal on the planet Pylong. As you are probably aware, 
we are never certain about the state of the zip file until the (*\schrod{}*) file has been opened.  
In the current case, the embedded (*\code{cat}*) command outputs the contents of the (*\schrod{}*) file 
and obfuscates the document when it opens. The resulting zip file contains the design of the database 
with the entity and attribute names shortened.  The zip file fortunately contains 
some snippets of data for entities which should help you build a real database from the design 
(NOTE: data may be incomplete and may have become corrupted).

You have been chosen for this assignment based on your unique scc.201 training which allows you 
to work on database designs using abstract symbols.
        
Agent Indigo has intermittent access to the data portal (based on the allignment of galactic objects 
(aka galactic events aka courswork submissions)).  Access to the portal allows us to populate the 
relation tables with additional data which is the final part to being able to create and interrogate the database. 
Agent Indigo requires coderunner credits in order to be able to access the relations portal during these 
galactic events to get data to populate the relation tables(where appropriate). Coderunner contains the 
private key for (*\schrod{}*) file which will allow the Triate to add queries (using a top secret babel module) 
which map the entities back to the un-obfuscated form.  Once that has been done, we will have everything we need. 
You will therefore have to create access points in a Just Another Virtual Application which can consume the 
new data.  Agent Pink has obtained examples of the data structures which are included in the 
Zylon Information Package.

WARNING: The database will be very large once fully populated with every known planet and human in the galaxy. 
Running queries against the database may take a long time.  It is imperative that the database is optimised 
for performance AND size.  Agent Green was unfortunately dehydrated because they did not have the scc.201 
indexing skills needed to optimise the database.  
(Initial attempts to rehydrate with beer were not successful.. a clear head is needed for this task). 
The coderunner instance will self destruct if either the queries take to long, or the database takes up 
to much file space.     Agent Indigo can only keep the portal to the relations data open for a short period of time.
    
Agent Purple suggests that we focus on entities 
'F' and 'R'.  Entity 'K' is also important to understanding communication channels being used.  
Entity 'S' should help to determine how to best utilise each super hero.

ESSENTIAL:  You must use the names of the entities and attributes provided.  
Not using the correct symbols will result in an F for FAILURE.    
 
The current galactic event is starting to fade and access to coderunner and the portal is likely to end soon. 
You should submit TWO files (solution.sql and Populator.java) using the secure 
Moons Of Oburon Data Logging Environment (MOODLE).

DO NOT transmit a Random Angry Rant  file (rar), 
because they have been known to be completely ignored by agent coderunner! 
Zylong Information Package files are also useless because the cat (if still alive) 
has been known to chew them up!
   
Hopefully I don't have to remind you that you are covered by the official secrets act 
(aka THE REGULATIONS: https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/student-and-education-services/exams-and-assessment/regulations/).  
Divulging your work to anyone apart from SCC.201 staff will be dealt with appropriately.   
    
Best of luck in your valiant efforts to understanding the designs and in building a working copy of the database.

The UNIVERSITY is depending on you.  

COMMANDER MOBOBO
    
    PS, we fear another COVID attack is imminent and need to find the probable birth place 
    and the current location of the super hero who is immune from all corona viruses.
